Player 1: `wad` to move and jump, `cvb` to raise and lower you gun and shoot.

Player 2: `ijl` to move and jump, `[]\` to raise and lower you gun and shoot.

## How to Play This Game
Open the `tank war.py` in your ide, and run it. And don't forget to pip install.

## Some Questions
In some (most \~_\~) ide, the window is so big that the whole screen can't contain it. And the only one I know that can display it in a normal size is `Thonny`. I guess it's the resolution's fault.
